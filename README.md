# hello-world

<p> Currently trying to create functions that return the max and min values of an array. </p>
<p> Must do so without using the already avaiable max and min array functions. Also cannot use the reverse and sort array functions. </p>
<p> Can essential only use the shift, unshift, push, and pop array functions.</p>
